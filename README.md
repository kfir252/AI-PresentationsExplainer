# Project Overview

This project is composed of three main parts:
1. Explainer
2. API
3. Client

## Running the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the main folder (the one that contains both the `Server` and `Client` folders).
2. Open three separate command prompt windows.
3. In the first command prompt window, run the following command and:

    ```bash
    python .\Server\main_Explainer.py
    ```
4.  Enter your OpenAI API key to connect the program with the OpenAI.

5. In the second command prompt window, run the following command:

    ```bash
    python .\Server\main_API.py
    ```

6. In the third command prompt window, run the following command:

    ```bash
    python .\Client\main.py
    ```

## Client Usage

The client has two versions, `colored` and `uncolored`.
You will be prompted to choose your preference when opening the client console.

The client is designed to provide a console application experience. Use the `help` command within the client to see a list of available actions and how to use them.
